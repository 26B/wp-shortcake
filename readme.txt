Shortcake makes using WordPress shortcodes a piece of cake.

== Description ==

Used alongside `add_shortcode`, Shortcake supplies a user-friendly interface for adding a shortcode to a post, and viewing and editing it from within the content editor.

See the [Github README](https://github.com/fusioneng/Shortcake/blob/master/README.md) for implementation notes. To report bugs or feature requests, [please use Github issues](https://github.com/fusioneng/Shortcake/issues).

== Installation ==

Shortcake can be installed like any other WordPress plugins. [Follow these integration steps](https://github.com/fusioneng/Shortcake#usage) to register UI for your shortcode.

== Screenshots ==

1. Without Shortcake, shortcodes have a minimal UI.
2. But with Shortcake, TinyMCE will render the shortcode in a TinyMCE view.
3. And add a user-friendly UI to edit shortcode content and attributes.
4. Add new shortcodes to your post through "Add Media".
